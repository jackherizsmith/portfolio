        <h3 class="feedback__title">Full of ideas, enthusiasm and positive spirit</h3>
        <p class="feedback__text">Jack is full of ideas, enthusiasm and positive spirit which makes working with him super fun and rewarding. In our project team he was open to building on everyone's ideas together and encouraging my random lines of thought by considering them and responding, "you're so right", even when I was unsure that I was. Jack channels his boundless energy into filling our cohort with fun analogies (mostly, but not limited to, cathedral metaphors), methods and tools, such that I learn something new from him every day, even when not directly working with him!</p>

      <article class="feedback">
        <h3 class="feedback__title">One thing for sure is that you'll learn something new by working with him</h3>
        <p class="feedback__text">Jack is an absolute joy to work with and one thing for sure is that you'll learn something new by working with him. One of his greatest strengths is his resourcefulness and he will always challenge the status quo to find new ways to solve a problem; this has led to the discovery of some fantastic new tools (Miro) which the entire cohort are now using.
          One thing value most about Jack is his leadership and I was continually impressed during his role as a scrum master. Both keeping the team laser focused on meeting project requirements and the task at hand. This coupled with a mindfulness of the individual needs of a team means Jack is an integral part of any group and a continual source of inspiration.</p>

        <h3 class="feedback__title">Always in search of the best way to implement something</h3>
        <p class="feedback__text">I had the privilege of being in the team that was first presented with Miro by Jack. The fact that it became mandatory for every project planning after week 4 says a lot about Jack. He is enthusiastic, curious, always in search of the best way to implement something and loves organisation - qualities that will keep you wondering what he is up to when you aren't fortunate enough to be working with him.</p>
